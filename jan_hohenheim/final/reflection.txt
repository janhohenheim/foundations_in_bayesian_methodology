> 1. What have you learnt in this course? For example, review your answers in the survey you completed at the beginning of the course. What has changed?

The fundamental difference is that I now know how to actually apply Bayesian methods.
I knew before how Bayesian thinking worked in theory, but would not have been able
to use it for any real-world analysis.

> 2. Which tools for organizing group collaboration can you recommend to future students?

A public repository on GitHub worked really well.
We all added our code to a shared file per exercise sheet.

> 3. How much time did it take you to complete all the tasks?

Probably around 4-6 hours per exercise sheet (including group tasks).
This means I took 5 * 6 = 30 hours.

> 4. What should be improved in this course and how?

I was not anticipating that the group tasks would have very different time commitments.
A little asterisk next to the task indicating its time estimate would have been helpful.
Something like: Task 1: Do XYZ *, Task 2: Do ABC ***, Task 3: Do DEF **.
For my own note-taking, it would have been helpful to have access to the whole script from the beginning.

> 5. What are the positive sides of this course? What did you like most?

I loved the practical aspect of the course. I especially liked how we were guided by
a real paper all throughout. This made the course feel very real and relevant.
I also appreciate how the exercises are setup such that we have the possibility
to hand in perfect solutions. This makes it feel like the goal was not to "weed out"
bad students, but to help us really learn and understand the material.
